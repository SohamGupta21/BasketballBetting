- **🔄 Validation**: Uses 2023-24 data to predict 2024-25 outcomes

## 🚀 Quick Start

### Installation

1. **Install Dependencies**:
   ```bash
   python3 setup_nba.py
   ```
   This will install `nba_api`, `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.

2. **Run NBA Simulation**:
   ```bash
   python3 main_nba.py
   ```

3. **Run Prediction Analysis**:
   ```bash
   python3 nba_score_prediction_analysis.py
   ```

### Usage Examples

**Simulate a Single Game**:
```python
from main_nba import sim_single_game

# Simulate Lakers vs Warriors
result = sim_single_game("Los Angeles Lakers", "Golden State Warriors")
print(f"Final Score: {result}")
```

**Run Season Simulation**:
```python
from main_nba import sim_season

# Simulate a 10-game season between two teams
season_results = sim_season("Boston Celtics", "Miami Heat", games=10)
```

**Analyze Model Performance**:
```python
from nba_score_prediction_analysis import main

# Run comprehensive analysis
analyzer, results = main()
```

## 🔧 How It Works

### 1. Data Collection
- Fetches real NBA team and player statistics using the `nba_api` package
- Collects seasonal averages: PPG, FG%, win percentage, plus-minus
- Converts NBA positions to simulation-compatible formats

### 2. Player Attribute Mapping
NBA stats are converted to simulation attributes (0-100 scale):
- **Shooting**: Based on field goal and 3-point percentages
- **Driving**: Derived from scoring efficiency and athleticism
- **Skills**: Calculated from assists, rebounds, and overall impact
- **Defense**: Based on defensive metrics and plus-minus

### 3. Game Simulation
- **Possession-by-possession** simulation with realistic game flow
- **Player fatigue** system affecting performance over time
- **Coaching decisions** for substitutions and strategy
- **Statistical variance** for realistic game-to-game differences

### 4. Score Prediction Algorithm
The model uses multiple factors to predict game scores:
```python
score = base_ppg + quality_adjustment + plus_minus_factor + shooting_efficiency + variance
```
- **Base PPG**: Team's average points per game
- **Quality Adjustment**: Based on win percentage difference (±8 points)
- **Plus-Minus Factor**: Scaled defensive/offensive impact (±3 points)
- **Shooting Efficiency**: Field goal percentage impact (±2 points)
- **Variance**: Random factor for realism (±4 points)

## 📈 Validation Results

Our model was validated by:
1. **Training** on 2023-24 NBA season data
2. **Predicting** 2024-25 season matchups
3. **Comparing** predictions against estimated actual results

**Key Findings**:
- Significantly outperforms random guessing (50% baseline)
- Predicts realistic NBA score ranges
- Shows strong correlation between team quality and predicted performance
- Minimal systematic bias in scoring predictions

## 🎨 Visualization Dashboard

The analysis generates a comprehensive dashboard (`nba_prediction_results.png`) showing:
- Winner prediction accuracy breakdown
- Score error distribution analysis
- Predicted vs actual score correlations
- Top performing predictions
- Model bias analysis
- Performance by game characteristics

## ⚡ API Rate Limiting

The system includes automatic rate limiting to respect NBA.com API limits:
- 0.5-second delays between API calls
- Caching system to reduce redundant requests
- Graceful error handling for API timeouts

## 🛠️ Technical Requirements

- **Python 3.7+**
- **nba_api**: Official NBA statistics API
- **pandas**: Data manipulation and analysis
- **matplotlib**: Visualization and plotting
- **seaborn**: Statistical data visualization
- **numpy**: Numerical computations

## 📊 Model Limitations

- Predictions based on season averages (doesn't account for injuries, recent form)
- "Actual" results are statistical estimates, not real game outcomes
- Model performance may vary with significant roster changes
- API rate limits may slow data collection for large analyses

## 🚀 Future Enhancements

- **Real-time injury data** integration
- **Player matchup analysis** (e.g., how guards perform against specific defenses)
- **Home court advantage** modeling
- **Recent form weighting** (last 10 games)
- **Playoff prediction** specialization
